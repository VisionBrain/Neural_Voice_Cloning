### ABSTRACT
Voice cloning is a highly desired feature for personalized speech interfaces. We introduce a neural voice cloning system that learns to synthesize a personâ€™s voice from only a few audio samples. We study two approaches: speaker adaptation and speaker encoding. Speaker adaptation is based on fine-tuning a multi-speaker generative model. Speaker encoding is based on training a separate model to directly infer a new speaker embedding, which is applied to a multi-speaker generative model. In terms of the naturalness of the speech and similarity to the original speaker, both approaches can achieve good performance, even with a few cloning audios.
